# PFAB Implementation Plan — Strategy D (Full Torch Migration)

**Living document.** Updated 2026-04-29. Strategy A complete and merged to `main`; Strategy D in progress on `feat/full-torch`.

## Status

**Strategy A — done, merged.** ~5.2× cumulative on smoke (130ms → 25ms), ~20× on schedule iteration (20s → 1s). Architecturally:
- Tensor-native `IPredictionModel` contract (A.1).
- Batched autoregressive prediction + vectorised DE acquisition (A.2 + Layer 4).
- KDE vectorised (`integrated_evidence_perturbed_batched` + joint-`_batched_joint` for schedule).
- `torch.compile` default-on with probe-fallback.
- Schedule mode routed through vectorised DE path (the perf fix).
- Soft bound penalty for schedule trajectories (no hard clipping).
- Profiler infrastructure for ongoing validation.
- Domain → Process phase split (commit 1 of unification — `_run_phase` generalised for N≥1, L≥1).

**Strategy D — active.** Full torch migration. Differentiable acquisition, drop scipy DE, drop all pandas DataFrames inside the framework, `nn.Module` normalisers, `nn.Embedding` categoricals, `torch.compile` over the entire acquisition graph. End state: numpy only at JSON I/O and matplotlib edges; everything else tensors.

`run_baseline` / `run_calibration` unification (Stage 3 of A) deferred to Strategy D — falls out naturally from the torch rewrite.

---

## Strategy D — what we're unlocking

The full migration delivers four classes of wins. **Per-class deletion** noted where it shrinks the codebase.

### 1. Optimisation: O(D²) DE → O(D) gradient-based

**~30-100× fewer acquisition evaluations** at typical D, more at higher D. DE's smart_maxiter scales `15D × popsize·D ≈ 12,000 evals at D=10`; gradient methods (`torch.optim.LBFGS` / Adam with multi-start) converge in ~50-200 evals.

For schedule iteration (currently 1s post-A): expect **~50-200ms**. Schedule with L=20 layers (currently impractical) becomes feasible.

**Deletion:** scipy.optimize.differential_evolution + L-BFGS-B → torch.optim. ~50 LOC of engine.run / engine._run_de scaffolding shrinks since torch.optim is simpler.

### 2. Hard bounds via reparameterisation

`x = sigmoid(z) · (hi - lo) + lo`. **`x ∈ [hi, lo]` strictly.** No drift, no clipping, no penalty tuning. The boundary issue we patched in `451cdd8` (soft bound penalty for schedule trajectories) **vanishes structurally** — it was a workaround for DE's offset-encoding drift; gradient + sigmoid eliminates the root cause.

**Deletion:** soft bound penalty (`451cdd8`), SolutionSpace's offset-encoding logic, trust-region delta bookkeeping. ~80 LOC.

### 3. Differentiable autoreg — the biggest structural win for recursive features

Today's recursive trajectory is opaque to the optimiser:
```
DE varies params → autoreg loop runs → final score
                   (opaque internal coupling)
```

With autograd, the trajectory becomes one composed graph:
```
params[step_0] ──┐
                 ├──> cell[0] prediction ──┐
                 │                          ├──> cell[1] (uses prev_layer = cell[0])
params[step_1] ──┘                          ├──> cell[2] (uses prev_layer = cell[1])
                                            ...
                                            └──> joint score
                                                  ↑
                                            backward() flows gradients back through everything
```

**Why this matters most for schedule**: the optimiser sees how changing step `k`'s parameter affects step `k+1`'s prediction *via the recursive feature*. Smoothness emerges naturally — adjacent steps with coherent trajectories are favoured without an explicit smoothing penalty. Trust-region offsets become semantic (small offset → small downstream effect), not bound-bookkeeping.

**Plus structural cleanups specifically for recursive features:**

| Current workaround | Strategy D replacement |
|---|---|
| K-refit (4 separate fits w/ annealed `p_student`) in `PredictionSystem.train` | Per-minibatch SS in `model.train()` with autograd-friendly mixing — ~5-line hook |
| `set_scheduled_sampling_state` + `_ss_predictions_by_exp` + `_perturb_recursive_features` (~120 LOC of stateful cache machinery in `DataModule`) | Single per-epoch hook in `train()` with `requires_grad=True` flowing through substitution |
| `_predict_autoregressive_batched` Python cell loop (Layer 4 collapsed inner numpy boundary, but loop itself remains) | `torch.jit.script`-able recursive function; multi-axis recursion exposes parallel inner dim (e.g. n_segments parallel within a layer step) |
| `_autoreg_predict_training_data` for cross-model SS pre-computation (~20 LOC) | Cross-model deps become graph edges; autograd tracks them automatically |
| NaN→0 conversion at `_one_hot_encode` for recursive boundary cells (implicit, fragile) | Explicit `boundary_value` tensor; `torch.where(mask, predicted, boundary_value)` blocks gradient cleanly |
| `_get_recursive_input_specs` + `recursive_plan` runtime walk + flat-index precompute (~40 LOC) | Dependency expressed as `torch.roll` in the prediction graph; no schema-walking at acquisition time |

**Total deletion enabled by recursive-features simplification: ~330 LOC of stateful workaround machinery**, plus the SS contract becomes more accurate (per-step gradient-traversable, not per-K-round).

**Future capability**: implicit differentiation through deep recursion. If schedules ever scale to L=50+ steps, naive backprop is memory-heavy; `torch.func.jvp` / fixed-point methods give gradients without storing intermediate states. Numpy can't do this without manually coding adjoint methods.

### 4. Tensor-native end-to-end + GPU + `torch.compile` over everything

- `agent.to('cuda')` works end-to-end after migration.
- `torch.compile` JIT-compiles the full acquisition graph (params → predict → eval → evidence → score). **2-5× more on top of everything else.** Today we can only compile the model's forward.
- All current "soft penalty" hacks become first-class differentiable terms (clamp saturation → smooth sigmoid, NaN handling → masked tensor ops, `_in_unit_cube` → smooth indicator).
- Cross-model dependency cycles become torch graph errors at construction, not silent silent runtime breakage.
- Data layer simplifies dramatically:

| Sub-topic | Deletion |
|---|---|
| **5a. One-hot → categorical-index tensors** (long-standing pain point) | ~80 LOC: `_col_extraction`, `_decode_one_hot`, one-hot-aware calibration array math → ~15 LOC. Models that need one-hot use `F.one_hot` themselves; learnable categoricals via `nn.Embedding`. |
| **5b. Normalisation as `nn.Module`** (`StandardScalerModule` etc.) | ~150 LOC: `_apply_normalization` / `_reverse_normalization` / `_compute_normalization_stats` / `get/set_normalization_state` → ~30 LOC. Stats live in `state_dict()`; serialise via `torch.save` for free. |
| **5c. Tensor-native `prepare_input`** | Drop `pd.DataFrame(all_rows)` round-trip in autoreg loop. `prepare_input` becomes tensor stack + normalisation apply. ~30 LOC saved per call site, with measurable inference-step savings. |
| **5d. `dataset.export_to_dataframe` → tensor dict** | ~20 LOC saved at the boundary. |

### Total Strategy D LOC delta

| Component | LOC change |
|---|---|
| Optimisation (DE → torch.optim) | −50 |
| Bounds (offset encoding → sigmoid reparam) | −80 |
| Recursive features (SS state + cell loop + cross-model cache) | −330 |
| Data layer (one-hot, normalisers, prepare_input, export) | −280 |
| KDE in torch (subsumes Topic 1's numpy implementation) | net 0 (replaces existing) |
| Plotting boundary tightening | ~+20 |
| Differentiable acquisition objective + multi-start | ~+200 |
| Sigmoid reparameterisation utilities | ~+40 |
| **Net** | **~−480 LOC, end-state simpler** |

## Strategy D — execution plan

8 commits, each independently revertable, gated by tests. Approximate order:

### Commit 1 — `params_to_tensor` / `tensor_to_params` (~150 LOC, 0.5 day)
Tensor-typed mirror of `params_to_array` / `array_to_params`. Round-trip + gradient-flow tests. Categoricals stay one-hot internally; the embedding migration (commit 5a) is additive.

### Commit 2 — `predict_for_calibration_tensor` (~200 LOC, 1 day)
Returns tensors at the API boundary (no numpy round-trip). The autoreg loop is already tensor-internal post-Layer 4; the change is dropping the final `stack_np = stack.detach().cpu().numpy()`. Adds optional `gradient_pass=True` kwarg on `model.forward_pass` to skip the no_grad context for the gradient path; default stays no-grad.

### Commit 3 — Tensor-native eval models (~180 LOC, 0.5 day)
`IEvaluationModel.compute_performance_tensor` returning `(S,)`. Mock overrides for the 3 evaluators (~10 LOC each using `torch.clamp` — differentiable except at clamp saturation; soft sigmoid fallback if pathologies appear). `EvaluationSystem._evaluate_feature_dict_tensor` parallel to the existing batched dispatch.

### Commit 4 — Tensor-native KDE (~250 LOC, 2 days) — *the hardest*
Rewrite `KernelField` + `KernelIndex` in torch. Sum of Gaussian probes evaluated at QMC points. `cKDTree` truncation replaced by dense distance broadcast `(M, K)` masked at 5σ — at our typical N≤50, the dense computation is faster than tree-build anyway.

`scipy.stats.qmc.Sobol` → `torch.quasirandom.SobolEngine` (built-in to torch). ~10 LOC change, gives QMC sequences in tensor land.

Side benefit: subsumes Topic 1 (numpy KDE vectorisation) — same algorithmic structure, just torch ops. The numpy version was a stepping stone, not thrown-away work.

### Commit 5 — Gradient optimiser + multi-start (~300 LOC, 1.5 days)
`OptimizationEngine.run_acquisition_gradient(objective_tensor, bounds, n_starts=4)` — multi-start `torch.optim.LBFGS` or Adam. ~50 epochs Adam or ~10-20 line searches L-BFGS per start.

Bounds via sigmoid reparameterisation: `x = sigmoid(z) · (hi - lo) + lo`. Smooth gradient, strict bounds.

`Optimizer.GRADIENT` enum value alongside `LBFGSB`, `DE`. Routed through `_run_phase` when `chosen_opt == GRADIENT` and tensor APIs available.

### Commit 6 — Phase C (per-minibatch SS) absorbed (~150 LOC, 1 day)
Per-epoch SS hook inside `TorchMLPModel.train()`. Deletes K-refit, `set_scheduled_sampling_state`, `_perturb_recursive_features`, `_ss_predictions_by_exp`. Net ~−120 LOC. Becomes natural with autograd-traversable substitution.

### Commit 7 — Data layer simplifications (~5 days, multi-commit)
- 7a. One-hot → categorical-index tensors + `nn.Embedding` opt-in for models that want learnable cats.
- 7b. Normalisation as `nn.Module` (`StandardScalerModule`, `MinMaxModule`, `RobustScalerModule`).
- 7c. Tensor-native `prepare_input` + `dataset.export_to_dataframe` → tensor dict.

### Commit 8 — Flip default optimiser, validate end-to-end (~0.5 day)
Default optimiser becomes `Optimizer.GRADIENT`. DE remains via `agent.configure_optimizer(backend=Optimizer.DE)`. Smoke + schedule iteration profile to confirm targets met.

### Total estimate

**~13-14 days** including thorough behavioural equivalence tests on `run_baseline(N=5)` at every commit that touches it. Each commit independently revertable.

## Reconsidered: PyTorch Lightning + `torch.utils.data.DataLoader`

Both still skip — the reasoning hardens with Strategy D context, doesn't soften.

### PyTorch Lightning — still no

Lightning's value props (Trainer, LightningModule, callbacks, distributed strategies) are centred on **training workflow boilerplate**. Strategy D's heavy lifting is OUTSIDE training:
- The biggest wins are in **acquisition** (DE → gradient), **KDE** (numpy → tensor), **data layer** (pandas → tensor). Lightning has nothing to offer for any of these.
- `TorchMLPModel.train()` remains tiny (~25 lines plus the per-minibatch SS hook from commit 6). Lightning would refactor this into `LightningModule.training_step` with ~60 lines of boilerplate scaffolding — net +40 LOC for no functional gain.
- Lightning's `Trainer` wants to **own** the training loop. PFAB's `PredictionSystem.train(model)` orchestrates training, manages topo-sort, handles cross-model SS pre-compute. Inverting control creates abstraction churn — `Trainer.fit(LightningModule, datamodule)` doesn't fit the orchestration shape.
- ~50 MB dependency footprint + transitive deps (jsonargparse, torchmetrics, lightning-utilities, fsspec). Strategy D adds none of these.

**Where Lightning would genuinely help (not now, possibly future):**
- Multi-GPU / distributed training. Not in scope.
- Mixed precision. Models too small to benefit.
- TensorBoard / WandB logger integration. PFAB has its own logger; minor benefit.
- Checkpointing standardisation. Currently nothing to checkpoint between sessions. `state_dict()` is one call away if needed.

**Verdict:** still skip. Re-evaluate if PFAB ever scales to multi-GPU or large hyperparameter sweeps.

### `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` — still no near-term value

Considered three sub-topics:

**A. Replace `Dataset` with `torch.utils.data.Dataset`** — reject. Different abstraction levels:
- PFAB `Dataset`: experiment-run container with schema validation, 3-tier persistence (memory↔local↔external), `create_experiment` / `save_experiment` / `load_experiment` lifecycle.
- `torch.utils.data.Dataset`: sample-level indexable iterable with `__getitem__(idx) → (X, y)` and `__len__`.

There's no overlap. Subclassing the latter would obscure the schema contract.

**B. Wrap `DataModule.get_batches` output in `DataLoader`** — reject for now. `DataLoader`'s value is workers + prefetching for I/O parallelism. We have ~100 rows in memory; no I/O bottleneck. After Strategy D's data-layer migration (commit 7), `get_batches` returns tensor dicts directly — even simpler than today.

**C. Use `LightningDataModule` interface** — reject. PFAB `DataModule` already exposes `get_batches(SplitType.TRAIN/VAL/TEST)`. Renaming to `train_dataloader()` / `val_dataloader()` / `test_dataloader()` is a cosmetic change without functional benefit.

**Verdict:** still skip. Revisit if PFAB ever has 100K+ training rows or per-cell features that benefit from prefetched I/O (e.g. images instead of scalar deviation values).

## Cross-cutting infrastructure

Already in place from Strategy A:
- **Profiler** (`PFAB_PROFILE=1` or `profiler.enable()`). Hot-path sections instrumented. Use for every Strategy D commit's perf validation.
- **Equivalence test scaffolding** (`tests/orchestration/test_evidence_batched.py`, `test_batched_predict.py`) — pattern at `atol=rtol=1e-5` for batched APIs. Strategy D adds gradient-flow unit tests on top.
- **Smoke test** (`pred-fab-mock/dev/_smoke_layer3.py --profile`) — fast end-to-end benchmark with profiling.
